Implementing a software renderer to understand topics like
rasterization,raytracing and other stuff, goal is to learn 
more about graphics and then move onto graphics APIs

# Goo software renderer

- olive.c by amista-azozien-houboudat is exactly what I
  have in mind

## Features
- outputs ppm for now
- drawing surface is pointer to an unsigned char variable
- specify color using a uint32_t?
